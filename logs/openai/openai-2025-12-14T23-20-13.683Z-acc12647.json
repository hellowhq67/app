Redesign the navbar with avatar dropdown and signout function\n4. Make everything responsive\n5. Redesign the homepage UI\n\nTo help you best, I need to understand:\n- What is the current state of the app? (Is it a new project or existing codebase?)\n- What framework/technology stack are you using?\n- Do you have any specific design requirements for the navbar and homepage?\n- Are there any existing components or code I should work with?\n\nPlease provide more details about your project so I can give you accurate guidance."
